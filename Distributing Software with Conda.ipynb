    "## Introduction\n",
    "Conda is a cross platform package, dependency, and environment management system distributes software of all languages. With conda, you can find, install, run and update packages and their dependencies. You can also create, save, load and switch between environments on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits of using conda in the COBRA lab. Although our programs are available on GitHub to be installed and compiled, this process can be troublesome for those with little insight on or little experience with installing and compiling source code. Our current processes this may work for our team and those in an interdisciplinary research field such as bioinformatics but may pose barriers for scholars and researchers from other fields who wish to use our programs. By packaging our programs with conda, we can expand our reach beyond our community with quick and easy-to-install packages while improving our own experience within the team. Moreover, the packaging process is simple and easy to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, conda...\n",
    "- Increases accessibility for anyone hoping to use our programs\n",
    "- Expands our reach beyond our current demographic\n",
    "- Enables quick and easy installation for new users\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "When first familiarizing yourself with conda, I highly recommend reading through the documentation, found at [https://docs.conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helpful Links\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single-page summary of the most important commands and information about using conda: [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)\n",
    "- conda-build documentation, including user guide and a tutorial: [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/index.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/index.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Important Concepts\n",
    "#### 1. Package managers\n",
    "A package manager, also known as a package-management system, simplifies and automates the installation, upgrade, configuration, and removal of computer programs. It handles packages - which contain metadata, including the package name, description, version number, vendor, dependencies list, etc. - and distributes software in archive files. Upon installation, the metadata is stored locally and maintained by the package manager to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. The purpose of package managers is to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates.\n",
    "##### Conda packages\n",
    "A conda package is a compressed tarball file (.tar.bz2) or .conda file that contains:\n",
    "- system-level libraries.\n",
    "- Python or other modules.\n",
    "- executable programs and other components.\n",
    "- metadata under the info/ directory.\n",
    "- a collection of files that are installed directly into an install prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "As both a package and dependency manager, conda keeps track of the dependencies between packages and platforms. The conda package format is identical across platforms and operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Environment managers\n",
    "While package managers manage packages, environment managers manage virtual environments to easily install, create, configure, and remove such environments.\n",
    "##### Virtual environments\n",
    "A virtual environment is a software tool that is an isolated environment with its own set of installed and managed packages, keeping dependencies required by different projects separate. If you change one environment, your other environments are not affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, rather than having to change your version of Python, you can simply create a virtual environment and install that package and the required version of Python into that environment. Using virtual environments can allow you to use multiple versions of a package on one computer without having to go back and forth between having to upgrade or downgrade it. Furthermore, virtual environments allows you to easily separate projects or packages that have conflicting dependencies, preventing them from being installed into your base environment.\n",
    "##### Conda environments\n",
    "A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages that are installed. You can easily switch between environments by activating or deactivating environments, as shown later. You can also share your environment with someone by giving them a copy of your environment.yaml file. More details on this are provided later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Conda as a management system\n",
    "Conda has many advantages, especially when compared to traditional package managers. Traditional package managers have certain limitations that conda solves or mitigates. For example, most package managers are often operating system specific whereas conda is platform independent. Traditional package managers may also be limited to a specific language, while conda can be used for any language. When switching between operating systems or programming languages, having to also switch between package managers can get confusing and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation process with traditional package managers can also be difficult and time consuming, especially if they require the user to download compatible compilers associated with the package before the installation. This is the case with package managers using source distributions. Conda makes the installation process quick and simple with no need to install compilers for any package. Furthermore, conda will manage and update dependencies as needed for the installation of a package. Another benefit to using conda as a management system is that it does not require a separate environment manager since it's both a package manager and environment manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, conda is a great management system because conda...\n",
    "- Has cross platform compatibility\n",
    "- Streamlines the management of libraries/packages\n",
    "- Is not limited to a specific language\n",
    "- Will check for and manage dependencies\n",
    "- Will not require the user to use a separate environment manager\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conda VS Pip\n",
    "![Table Outlining the Differences Between conda and Pip](images/conda-vs-pip.jpg \"conda vs pip\")\n",
    "\n",
    "conda and Pip, a commonly used Python package manager, are often considered to be identical, but there are some key differences. As seen in the table above, conda does not require compilers because it uses binaries, but Pip sometimes will for source distributions. As previously discussed, users won’t be required to install compatible compilers before invoking the package manager in order to succeed with the package installation. This makes conda more efficient and user friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key difference between the two tools is that conda has the ability to create and manage isolated virtual environments that can contain different versions of Python and/or the packages installed in them. This is useful when working with different tools since they may contain conflicting requirements, which could prevent them from being installed in the same environment. Pip has no built in support for environments but rather relies on other tools like Virtualenv or Venv to create virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip and conda also differ in how dependency relationships within an environment are fulfilled. When installing packages, Pip installs dependencies in a recursive, serial loop. No effort is made to ensure that the dependencies of all packages are fulfilled simultaneously. This can lead to environments that are broken in subtle ways. This broken behaviour may arise if packages installed earlier in the order have incompatible dependency versions relative to packages installed later in the order. In contrast, conda uses a satisfiability solver to verify that all requirements for every package installed in an environment are met. This check can take extra time but helps prevent the creation of broken environments. As long as package metadata about dependencies is correct, conda will predictably produce working environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extended details regarding the comparison between conda and Pip, I recommend reading this website: [https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-vs-pip](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-vs-pip).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conda VS Conan\n",
    "\n",
    "While researching conda, I sought out alternative package managers to explore which may offer a better overall user experience and came across Conan. Conan is a MIT-licensed, open source package manager specific to the development of C and C++ software. Although Conan offered more tools specific to C and C++, they were unnecessary for the purposes of our programs. Furthermore, there was a steep learning curve associated with using its technologies to package programs. There is a limited amount of accessible resources provided online to aid learning, and I found conda more straight-forward and comfortable to use. Moreover, conda is more widely-used than Conan, making conda a preferrable system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Conda channels\n",
    "Conda channels are the locations where packages are stored and serve as the base for hosting and managing packages. Conda packages are downloaded from remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages. By default, packages are automatically downloaded and updated from the default channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/ but the channel can be specified in the command line as shown later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "The first step in building conda packages is to install conda. An installation guide is provided at [https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient method of installing conda is to [install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a mini version of Anaconda (hence Miniconda) that includes only conda and its dependencies while only requiring approximately 400MB of storage. [Anaconda installation](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/) is slower and requires at minimum 3GB of storage but provides over 1,500 other open source packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Anaconda if you:\n",
    "- Have the time and disk space---a few minutes and 3 GB.\n",
    "- Are new to conda or Python.\n",
    "- Like the convenience of having over 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Miniconda if you:\n",
    "- Do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually.\n",
    "- Do not have time or disk space to install over 1,500 packages at once.\n",
    "- Want fast access to Python and the conda commands and you wish to sort out the other programs later.\n",
    "\n",
    "![conda, miniconda, anaconda](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/conda-vs-miniconda-vs-anaconda.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using conda\n",
    "### Management with conda\n",
    "#### Managing conda\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda --version`: prints your version of conda. Can be used as a method to verify that conda is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda info`: prints all the details regarding conda on your computer. Can also be used as a method to verify that conda is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda update conda`: updates conda to the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing channels\n",
    "When installing a package, conda will search all configured channels but it may encounter a situation where multiple channels have the same package with the same version. Thus, conda sets channel priorities to determine which channel to install from. By default, the highest priority channel is https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main.\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining which to install from the package list, conda sorts as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorts the package list from highest to lowest version number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sorts tied packages from highest to lowest channel priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sorts tied packages from highest to lowest build number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Channel commands\n",
    "`conda config --add channels new_channel`: adds a new channel as the highest priority.\n",
    "- Equivalently, `conda config --prepend channels new_channel` also adds a new channel as the highest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda config --append channels new_channel`: adds a new channel as the lowest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Because build numbers from different channels are not comparable, build number still comes after channel priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing packages\n",
    "As a package manager, conda helps to find, install, etc. conda packages.\n",
    "\n",

    "To update conda-build, run `conda update conda-build`.\n",
    "#### 2. Recipes\n",
    "Building a conda package requires a [recipe](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/concepts/recipe.html). When building a package, conda-build renders the package by reading a template in the [meta.yaml](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html) which contains all the metadata, including compilers required for the package build. The [conda-recipes repo](https://github.com/conda-archive/conda-recipes) contains example recipes for many conda packages.\n",

    "#### 3. Build scripts\n",
    "When building a package, conda requires a [build script](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/build-scripts.html) - either a build.sh file (for Linux and macOS) or bld.bat file (for Windows) - to run the terminal command lines for compiling and making the binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE: compatible compilers may be required to be installed on the computer used for the package-building process.</b> \n",
    "[Anaconda comes pre-installed with various compiler tools](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/compiler-tools.html), but Miniconda will require you to install the compilers yourself.\n",
    "#### 4. Conda-build command arguments\n",
    "`conda build RECIPE_PATH`\n",
    "- builds the package according to the meta.yaml file and build script located at the specified path.\n",
    "    - to build in the current directory: `conda build .`\n",
    "    \n",
    "`conda build purge`\n",
    "- cleans the ~/anaconda/conda-bld directory of all old temporary build directories including their work and test intermediates. \n",
    "![conda build purge example](images/conda-build-purge.jpg)\n",
    "`conda build purge-all`\n",

    "`conda convert`\n",
    "- converts the specified package for the specified operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `-p` to specify the platform:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 5. Build process\n",
    "When conda-build builds a new package on your local computer, all files to be packaged are copied into a temporary working directory named according to the package name and the time and date. For example, if the package uses files from a git repository, all the files from the git repository are cloned into this directory. This temporary directory is located in `~/anaconda/conda-bld/` during the build and is removed upon a successful package build. If you have unsuccessful builds, these \n",
    "working directories are not deleted and are kept in ~/miniconda/conda-bld/ until a `conda build purge` command is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> `~/miniconda/` if using miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "- ex: `~/miniconda3/conda-bld/pkg_0123456789012`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Important notes\n",
    "Before you attempt packaging, first ensure the program compiles and runs properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Build directory name\n",
    "On macOS and Linux, conda-build pads the build prefix to 255 characters by appending `\\_placehold`s to the end of the build directory name. Thus, the program must allocate at least 255 bytes for the directory name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Note:</b> be careful with under allocating. In some cases, the build will still complete and appear successful, but the program will not function properly when used. However, this error will be reported during the build, regardless of whether the build completes or not. If you find that your package does not work as expected despite a completed build, go back and read through the build messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "![error during package build](images/conda-folder-name.jpg)\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Installing the program\n",
    "Without installation specifications, programs are built and installed in the temporary working directory during packaging but immediately removed upon a successful build. You must specify the commands for the install in the build script. For Python, assuming you have written and included a setup script in the files to be packaged, this requires the `python setup.py install` command to install the Python package. For compiled languages, the executible built during the build must be moved or copied to somewhere in <code>&#x24PREFIX</code> (e.g. <code>&#x24PREFIX/bin</code>). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dependencies built with the program\n",
    "In the case where the package includes dependencies that are built with the program (e.g., simfold), the program and its dependencies must be moved or copied into <code>&#x24PREFIX</code> *before* the command to build the program. In other words, the program and its dependencies must be built somewhere inside <code>&#x24PREFIX</code>. This is because the program executible is linked to the path(s) where the dependencies were built. If the package is built in the default temporary build directory rather than <code>&#x24PREFIX</code>, the executible will be linked to that temporary directory and look for the dependencies there. The packaging will still complete, however, despite this creating problems and resulting in a broken package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Build instructions\n",
    "Steps to build a package:\n",
    "1. Create a directory for the project\n",

    "## Tutorials\n",
    "### Building a Python Package: click\n",
    "This tutorial builds a package for click, a Python program, from a tarball file and is based on the example provided by docs.conda.io: [\"Building conda packages from scratch\"](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html). The instructions below follow this tutorial but with updated instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a directory for the project\n",
    "Make a new directory and switch into that directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`mkdir click`<br>\n",
    "`cd click`\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory will store the recipe and build script(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create the recipe\n",
    "Copy the following and create a meta.yaml file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{% set name = \"click\" %}\n",
    "{% set version = \"8.1.3\" %}\n",
    "\n",
    "package:\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> for this package build, only package/name, package/version, source/url, source/sha256, and requirements/host are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating the meta.yaml file in the terminal\n",
    "- Bash (Linux and macOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the ../click/ directory,\n",
    "    1. <code>&#x24 cat > meta.yaml</code>: creates the meta.yaml file and allows you to input data.\n",
    "    2. (ctrl + V) / (cmd + V): pastes the file contents copied from above.\n",
    "    3. (ctrl + D): terminates input and saves the file.\n",
    "    4. <code>&#x24 cat meta.yaml</code>: prints the contents of the file (to verify).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the ../click/ directory,\n",
    "    1. `C:\\> copy con meta.yaml`: creates the meta.yaml file and allows you to input data.\n",
    "    2. (ctrl + V): pastes the file contents copied from above.\n",
    "    3. (ctrl + Z): terminates input.\n",
    "    4. Enter: saves the file.\n",
    "    5. `C:\\> type meta.yaml`: prints the contents of the file (to verify).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Write the build script\n",
    "While only one build script is necessary, there also won't be any issues with building a package if you have both a build.sh and bld.bat file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python packages, because no compilation is required, only a command to install the script is required, so your build script(s) should look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### build.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>&#x24PYTHON setup.py install</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### bld.bat\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"%PYTHON%\" setup.py install` <br>\n",
    "`if errorlevel 1 exit 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it is best practice to add `if errorlevel 1 exit 1` after every command so that if the command fails, the build fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Building the package\n",
    "After completing steps 1-3, your directory should now look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "click\n",
    "├── bld.bat\n",
    "├── build.sh\n",
    "└── meta.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To build, use the command `conda build .`. If you are not in the ../click/ directory, use `conda build RECIPE_PATH`, where RECIPE_PATH is the path to the directory holding the meta.yaml and build script(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Converting the package\n",
    "When you build a package, that build is built only for the platform you are using to built the package. Once the build is successful, you have the option to convert the package to different platforms using the command `conda convert -p PLATFORM PACKAGE_PATH`, where PLATFORM is the target platform and PACKAGE_PATH is the path to the package. By default, it will be located at ~/anaconda/conda-bld/PLATFORM/click-8.1.3-0.tar.bz2. For example, on my computer, it is located at ~/miniconda3/conda-bld/linux-64/click-8.1.3-0.tar.bz2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> at times, the conversion will appear to be successful but fail in actuality. This is because the build process is specific to the platform used so some dependencies (e.g., C++ libraries) used in the build may be specific to that platform as well. To mitigate this, rebuild the package using the target platform, either with a virtual machine or computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here, it appears KnotAli was successfully converted from Linux 64-bit to macOS 64-bit:\n",
    "![conda convert appears successful](images/conda-convert-success.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after [uploading the package](#Uploading-Packages) and attempting to install on macOS 64-bit:\n",
    "![conda convert fail](images/conda-convert-fail.jpg)\n",

    "### Building a C++ Package: HFold\n",
    "This tutorial builds a package for HFold, one of the methods from the COBRA Lab, from a [git repository](https://github.com/HosnaJabbari/HFold). This tutorial is intended to be a reference point for packaging the methods (written in C++) from our lab. As these methods are only compatible with Linux and macOS, this tutorial will only demonstrate the packaging process with bash commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before you package\n",
    "Before packaging, ensure you have access to either a Linux or macOS machine. If your computer operates on Windows, you will need to install a virtual machine. \n",

    "4. Create a new directory for the vagrant file and move the file there.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the directory, create a new folder named `mirror`. This will be a shared directory between your host machine and the virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the terminal, use the command `vagrant up` in the directory to set up the virtual machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - `vagrant up` is also used to boot-up the virtual machine.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "7. In the terminal, use the command `vagrant ssh` to establish an SSH session into the running virtual machine. This will give you shell access from your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. When you are done with using the virtual machine shell, use `vagrant suspend` or `vagrant halt` to safely power off the virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can access and use the virtual machine by using the VirtualBox application and booting up the virtual machine.\n",
